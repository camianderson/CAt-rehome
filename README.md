## Overview

CAt Rescue offers much more than the photo of your new best friend: in it, the user also finds the cat's profile with important information such as age, gender, size, vaccination status and health conditions. You can also learn a little more about the cat's personality: if it likes to play, if it is affectionate, temperamental, etc.

This is the perfect place for you to choose your new companion! The site provides the contacts of who is responsible for each cat making the adoption easy and practical. The user can get in direct contact with any questions and proceed with the adoption process.

In doubt? You can save your favorite cats and then make a decision. Our "favorites" tab registers the cats you like the most!
For those who rescue animals, we have the "rehome a cat" button, where you can register a cat and make it available for adoption. In the form, just fill in the name of the animal, life stage, size, gender, register if the cat has any health condition and add a minibio with useful information about its personality, along with a photo and the means of contact.

A simple and efficient alternative to find a new home for cats!
