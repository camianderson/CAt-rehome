      "about": "With her sleek black coat and her mitten-like front paws, teenager kitty Polly is irresistibly adorable and playful. She loves nothing more than to play with everything and everyone, and anything can be a toy for Polly. Polly loves to scamper through cat tunnels, chase and pounce, and run around with the other kitties in her foster home. While it takes her a little time to warm up to people, once she is comfortable, she is happy to accept pets and even belly rubs. She likes to keep you company while you are on the computer. She would be happiest in a home with at least one other playful young cat",

Sarge has a big personality and likes to 'own' any room he happens to occupy and will let you know by his assertive vocalizations that he is in charge! He is active and curious, and absolutely adores being around people of all ages (males and females). He will be happiest in a home where he has some safe access to the outside, such as a catio or a well-fenced backyard (he even enjoys rides in a stroller!)",

      "about": "Mr Mooglow is super friendly. He is affectionate and likes to be with people. His friendliness with other cats is random, but could be some insecurities due to his impaired vision. Moonie can see and has no problem getting around at this time. Moonie has cataracts in both eyes, in which there is no treatment. He has glaucoma in his right eye. This eye requires an eye drop twice daily. The eye drops relieve the pressure caused by the glaucoma. At some point this condition could worsen and would require the eye to be removed. Mr Moonglow needs an adopter that will be committed to his ongoing care. A stable home that is on the quiet side, but full of play time and kitty shenanigans!!",

She follows her mom to the kitchen every morning and sits promptly on the floor ready to be brushed and have her rump scratched. Thora has a couple of cats in her home that she 'tolerates', but does not like a lot of other cats around. She is passive and stays to herself mostly. Her favorite spot is at the top of the kitty tower. We believe Thora will thrive given a chance in the right home!",
